# Working notes

Plain, current working notes for whoever (or whatever) picks the project up
next. Infrastructure and operations live outside this repository.

## Where the music stands (musician-11)

- One deterministic composer (`src/composer.js`): a token maps to the same
  song forever. No randomness, time, DOM, or network in the musical path.
- Fourteen style archetypes (anthem, house, trance, techno, dnb, breaks,
  arcade, rock, punk, funk, boombap, chill, ballad, drone), each owning tempo
  band, kit signature, bass engine, accompaniment pool, harmony type, swing
  and melody density.
- Pattern pools are mined from a 74,552-file VGM MIDI corpus (joint kit bars,
  bass onset masks, 4-bar chord movements) via `scripts/distill-style-corpus.js`
  into `src/style-corpus.js`. The miner is a stdlib-only Python script with
  its own MIDI parser.
- The instrument bank pairs corpus patches with an authored palette
  (4 duties x 5 envelope characters, 6 wave shapes, 4 noises) in
  `src/gb-hardware.js`; a per-style TIMBRE table dresses each style.
- Hardware articulations run in BOTH engines: the channel-1 sweep unit
  (slides) and per-frame vibrato tables live in the browser Sequencer
  (`src/gb-apu.js`) and the generated cartridge driver (`src/gb-rom.js`),
  kept honest by `npm run test:rom-audio` (spectral comparison of the browser
  chip against the ROM executing on the CPU emulator).

## Invariants worth knowing before touching anything

- `verify-rom-audio` is the referee: any audio change must land in the
  Sequencer and the ROM driver together or parity breaks.
- Vibrato steps BEFORE each frame's events in both engines; the ordering is
  what keeps the two age counters frame-identical.
- The smoke contract (`scripts/smoke-generated-seeds.js`) holds the lead
  under 72% of bars and requires kick+snare from every kit.
- Indexed screens (Game Boy / NES): hueRot returns the base colour while a
  palette is installed; per-variant scheme hints (`st.nesSchemes`) outrank
  the static table; packs must read the live unit `U` every frame (a pinned
  make()-time unit rendered the climber gigantic after a face switch).

## Create (the editor at /create)

- The mood box and chips do parameter-space seed search, NOT curation: mood
  words map to the composer's own dials (style id, mode family, tempo band)
  and `composeIntoGrid` compiles random seeds (~0.4ms each, 140 cap) until
  one's declared parameters match. Owner asked for exactly this (2026-08-26);
  it never scores output quality, and Create never feeds the station.
- A composed roll plays the REAL score verbatim, full length (`liveScore`:
  its own bank, all instruments, no loop; at the end the same mood composes
  the next song). Editing is LOSSLESS: every projected cell carries the
  exact inst/midi/len/vel/ch/sweep (URL hash v3 serializes them), and
  buildSong plays cells from those fields, so a hand edit keeps the whole
  arrangement. The composer's bank IS buildBank(patches) -- pickBank only
  selects role indices from it -- which is why bare instrument indices
  survive the trip. Remaining loss: onsets/lengths step-quantize to 16ths,
  swing timing flattens, and same-column notes folding to one row drop.
- Drag right on a note stretches it (len steps); a tap removes it; leaving
  the row switches to line painting. The More drawer offers every melodic
  bank instrument as a generated waveform icon ('i<N>' stamps).
- Command stamps (one in hand at a time; cell flags): z Fall / u Rise
  (hardware sweep, claims pulse 1), q Arp, g Retrig, f Echo (echo defaults
  len 4; g/f work on drums). All expand in buildSong into ordinary chip
  notes -- no engine changes, parity untouched. URL hash v4 adds one cmd
  char per cell; v1-v3 links still decode.
- Channel lanes: P1/P2/WAV/NOI chips (click mutes, S solos) drive a
  chip-side 'chmute' message -- the Sequencer skips triggers for masked
  channels and note-offs the newly muted -- so muting bites instantly on
  grid songs AND verbatim compositions. Session-only, never serialized;
  playScore() clears the mask so the radio can never come back muted.
  Cells wear a left-edge tick in their resolved channel's color (rch,
  computed by buildSong) and dim while their lane is muted.
- The grid is a TIMELINE: the whole track as one strip of bar panels with a
  camera (follows the playhead; wheel/header-drag pans and disengages;
  play/resume re-engages). Bars are patterns: header glyphs duplicate and
  delete, the ghost "+" bar extends, up to 63 bars. URL hash v2 is 4 chars
  per cell (2-char columns); v1 links still decode.
- The app's `Audio` is a top-level `const`: a global lexical binding, never a
  `window` property. `window.Audio` is the native HTMLAudioElement
  constructor. Always reference the bare name.
- dmg/nes palette systems quantize fillStyle/strokeStyle on the GLOBAL canvas
  prototype; UI canvases must set `canvas.__ctpalRaw = true` or translucent
  fills silently vanish while a panel face is active.
- The chip never rebuilds at a loop seam (`Sequencer.rewind()`) or track
  swap (APU carry + `cutNotes()`): a fresh APU's power-on DAC writes through
  a reset output capacitor are an audible pop.

## Create: the alive posture (Nanoloop wave 1, 2026-08-26)

- The editor is ALWAYS running: open() starts the transport (silent until
  the first gesture resumes audio), and a first visit with no draft
  composes a gentle song immediately -- never a blank page.
- Loop-a-bar: tapping a bar's number loops just that bar (a sliced song,
  sliceForBar) while editing; tapping again releases to the whole song.
  currentSong() is the one source for playback/repost; exports still use
  the full song.
- Notes: body-drag moves (exact midis shift diatonically; drums adopt the
  new lane), right-edge drag stretches, tap removes. cellSpanAt hit-tests
  the whole tail. Cells pulse as the playhead fires them.
- The hint bar (.cr-hint) narrates: data-tip hover mirrors into it, first
  placement and the first sulk explain themselves once.
- Touch: coarse pointers get 32px cells; two-finger pinch zooms the
  timeline width (cwZoom).
- URL v5: bpm rides as (bpm-70)/2. Plain bpm/2 overflowed six bits for
  tempos >= 128 and every such link loaded at ~70 (bug existed since v1).

## Create wave 2 (2026-08-26)

- Queue-next-bar: while a bar loops, tapping another bar's number queues it
  (amber outline) and it takes over exactly at the loop wrap. Tapping the
  looping bar still releases to the whole song.
- Accents: double-tap a note to cycle soft/normal/loud (vel 0.5/0.8/1.0);
  a single tap still removes, deferred 260ms to leave room for the second
  tap. Icon size follows velocity.
- The sound pad: every melodic instrument plotted on a brightness-by-
  sustain map inside the More drawer (padPoints/drawPad/padPick); dragging
  snaps to the nearest sound and auditions as you go.
- The Songs shelf ('Songs' in the toolbar): save/load/delete named songs in
  localStorage ('ct-create-shelf', encode strings, cap 30).
- URL v6: the cell extension rides whenever ANY exact field exists
  (v5 gated it on inst alone and silently dropped hand-placed stretches
  and accents from links); inst encodes as inst+1 so 0 means none.

## Create wave 3 (2026-08-26)

- First-run tour: three anchored cards (grid / bar loop / moods), each
  advancing on the real action or Next; 'ct-create-tour' in localStorage
  gates it forever after. Shown only on the fresh-visit path.
- Phone: the mood chips and palette are single scrolling rows (hidden
  scrollbars), chrome tightens, the title hides, touch-action:manipulation
  kills double-tap zoom, and the grid canvas owns its gestures
  (touch-action:none).

## Create rebuilt as a pocket tracker (2026-08-26)

- The timeline/palette UI is gone. One screen: a 4x4 step grid shows one
  bar of one voice (tap toggles, vertical drag pitches diatonically,
  horizontal drag stretches, drums drag between kick/snare/hat); four
  channel buttons (tap switches, tap the lit one mutes, hold opens the
  sound map scoped to that voice, picked per channel in chInst[]); a bar
  strip walks the song (tap views, the ring button loops the current bar,
  tapping another bar while looping queues it for the wrap); mood row and
  Share (link/WAV/ROM) on top. The whole engine (cells, buildSong,
  liveScore, encode v1-6, shelf, chip glue) is unchanged.
- Command stamps, eraser, accents, and solo lost their UI; cells carrying
  those flags still play. Channel view mapping: explicit ch, else rch from
  buildSong, else P1; the composer assigns pulse channels per seed, so a
  seed may use only one of P1/P2 -- the views report what is real.
- Decode bug fixed: the cell extension's channel read (e1>>3)&7, swallowing
  the midi flag into the channel since v3, so decoded links corrupted
  explicit channels (playback survived via the budget fallback). The
  encoder always wrote correct bits, so old links heal on load.
