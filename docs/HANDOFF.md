# Working notes

Plain, current working notes for whoever (or whatever) picks the project up
next. Infrastructure and operations live outside this repository.

## Where the music stands (musician-11)

- One deterministic composer (`src/composer.js`): a token maps to the same
  song forever. No randomness, time, DOM, or network in the musical path.
- Fourteen style archetypes (anthem, house, trance, techno, dnb, breaks,
  arcade, rock, punk, funk, boombap, chill, ballad, drone), each owning tempo
  band, kit signature, bass engine, accompaniment pool, harmony type, swing
  and melody density.
- Pattern pools are mined from a 74,552-file VGM MIDI corpus (joint kit bars,
  bass onset masks, 4-bar chord movements) via `scripts/distill-style-corpus.js`
  into `src/style-corpus.js`. The miner is a stdlib-only Python script with
  its own MIDI parser.
- The instrument bank pairs corpus patches with an authored palette
  (4 duties x 5 envelope characters, 6 wave shapes, 4 noises) in
  `src/gb-hardware.js`; a per-style TIMBRE table dresses each style.
- Hardware articulations run in BOTH engines: the channel-1 sweep unit
  (slides) and per-frame vibrato tables live in the browser Sequencer
  (`src/gb-apu.js`) and the generated cartridge driver (`src/gb-rom.js`),
  kept honest by `npm run test:rom-audio` (spectral comparison of the browser
  chip against the ROM executing on the CPU emulator).

## Invariants worth knowing before touching anything

- `verify-rom-audio` is the referee: any audio change must land in the
  Sequencer and the ROM driver together or parity breaks.
- Vibrato steps BEFORE each frame's events in both engines; the ordering is
  what keeps the two age counters frame-identical.
- The smoke contract (`scripts/smoke-generated-seeds.js`) holds the lead
  under 72% of bars and requires kick+snare from every kit.
- Indexed screens (Game Boy / NES): hueRot returns the base colour while a
  palette is installed; per-variant scheme hints (`st.nesSchemes`) outrank
  the static table; packs must read the live unit `U` every frame (a pinned
  make()-time unit rendered the climber gigantic after a face switch).
